📖 About the Project

BOTIQ is a smart virtual assistant designed to make human-computer interaction more natural and efficient. It uses speech recognition to understand spoken commands, processes them with the power of GPT-based AI models, and responds back through both text and speech.

The main goal of BOTIQ is to provide a hands-free, intelligent, and interactive assistant that can answer questions, hold conversations, and perform basic tasks. Unlike traditional chatbots that rely only on text input, BOTIQ brings together:

🎙️ Voice Input – Speak directly instead of typing.

💬 Chat Interface – See answers in a conversational style.

🔊 Voice Output – Hear the assistant speak naturally.

🧠 AI Integration – Smart responses powered by GPT.

BOTIQ is not just a chatbot – it’s a step toward building a personal AI companion that adapts to user needs and improves the way we interact with technology.
