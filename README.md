📖 About the Project

BOTIQ is a smart virtual assistant designed to make human-computer interaction more natural and efficient. It uses speech recognition to understand spoken commands, processes them with the power of GPT-based AI models, and responds back through both text and speech.


🎙️ Voice Input – Speak directly instead of typing.

💬 Chat Interface – See answers in a conversational style.

🔊 Voice Output – Hear the assistant speak naturally.

🧠 AI Integration – Smart responses powered by GPT.

BOTIQ is not just a chatbot – it’s a step toward building a personal AI companion that adapts to user needs and improves the way we interact with technology.
